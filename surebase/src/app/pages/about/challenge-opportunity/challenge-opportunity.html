    <h2>The Challenge: A Disconnected Industry</h2>
    <p>
      The insurance landscape in emerging markets, particularly Nigeria, faces a critical challenge:
      fragmentation. Vast untapped potential lies dormant, waiting to be unlocked. Yet, a clear
      disconnect exists between licensed insurance providers and innovative digital distribution
      channels like fintechs and banks. This fragmentation results in slow processes, limited reach,
      and a significant barrier to entry for both traditional insurers and modern digital platforms.

    <h2>The Opportunity: A Digital Catalyst</h2>
    <p>
      We saw an opportunity to build the essential, yet often overlooked, infrastructure that could
      bridge this gap. As digital adoption soared and the demand for embedded insurance grew, it
      became clear that a single, unified platform was needed to connect the entire ecosystem.
      Surebase was born from this vision: to become the digital catalyst for a modernized insurance
      industry.
